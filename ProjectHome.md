The BioSimConnector discovers semantic connections between annotated biosimulation models. These connection paths represent potential avenues for integrating multiple biological models to compose more complex systems.

The tool finds model-model connections using a custom RDF triple store that integrates information from the BioModels database, the CellML model repository, and the Homo sapiens Reactome.
